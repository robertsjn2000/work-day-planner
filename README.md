# work-day-planner
## Description
My motivation for this project was my need for a daily planner that could store tasks that I input so I can keep track of them.
It helps solve the problem of keeping your day organized. It also keeps track of the live time and will adjust the calendars styles based on the current time.
## Usage
Simply run the webpage and input your daily tasks in the corresponding time slot.
